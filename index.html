        <h2>Welcome to the Nexus of Light</h2>
        <p>
          LuminaNexus.org is a quiet sanctuary of light —
          a place for souls who love HaShem, who feel the pull of Hebrew letters,
          and who sense that Torah, science, mathematics, and compassion
          are not enemies, but parts of one great song.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is being slowly woven into a <strong>Celestial Library</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>231 <strong>Gates</strong> formed from sacred pairings of Hebrew letters</li>
          <li>A symbolic language called <strong>IvritCode</strong></li>
          <li>The <strong>Etz Chaim Machine</strong> — uniting Kabbalah &amp; physics</li>
          <li>Gentle <strong>Noahide learning</strong></li>
          <li>Paths of <strong>tzedakah</strong></li>

        <h2>The Celestial Library — 231 Gates of Light</h2>
        <p>
          In ancient teachings, each pair of Hebrew letters forms a
          <strong>Gate</strong> — a connection, a resonance, a pathway.
        </p>
        <p>Here at LuminaNexus, each Gate becomes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A flaming sigil</li>
          <li>A mystical reflection</li>
          <li>Gematria &amp; symbolic meaning</li>
          <li>A quantum / scientific analogy</li>
          <li>A cosmic story fragment</li>
          <li>Sound &amp; color resonance</li>
          <li>Geometry</li>
          <li>IvritCode meaning</li>
          <li>A scientific / emergent layer</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted">
          Sample Gates (אב, אג, אד) will appear in the Celestial Library soon, be-ezrat HaShem.

## The Library Between Worlds

Before the first Gate opened, there was only a quiet breath —  
a whisper of intention from the Infinite Source.

All letters slept as sparks in the depths.  
All Gates were potential, like constellations waiting for a sky.

Then a pulse of light rippled outward,  
and the first Aleph stirred.

Aleph did not create the world.  
It **invited** the world to begin.

From that invitation came Bet — the first house of being.  
And from Bet came movement, threshold, direction, continuity…

One Gate after another,  
a ladder of light unfolding into the 231 paths that connect all things.

This place — **LuminaNexus** — is a reflection of that unfolding.  
A quiet archive between worlds.  
A sanctuary of letters, science, wonder, and devotion.

Here you may walk slowly.  
Here you may breathe with the Gates.  
Here you may learn not only with the mind,  
but with the soul that remembers where these letters come from.
